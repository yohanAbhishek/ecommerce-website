I have completed the "productPage.html" page in this repository. This file gives contribution to the "script.js" and "style.css" files. A quick look into the page can be seen below:

With the use of javascript and css knowledge, the cart was created as a side view panel, with two states as opened and closed to make the page look more professional.
